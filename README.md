The Expense Tracker is a web application that simplifies managing and visualizing everyday expenses. It features a user-friendly form where individuals can input details such as the date, type, amount, and a description of their expenses. The application dynamically updates a pie chart, created by the Chart.js library, to display the distribution of expenses across various categories, such as Rent, Utilities, and Groceries. This visual representation helps users quickly grasp their spending patterns.

Additionally, users can view their expenses in a sortable table, which provides a clear overview of all entries. The application allows for individual expense deletion or complete clearing of all expenses. The interface is designed for ease of use, with a fixed header and footer, and styled with CSS to ensure a cohesive and attractive layout.
